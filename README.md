## Coach Finder

This project is specifically designed to refresh fundamental aspects of Vue.js, including Vue Router and Vuex. It focuses on building a coach finder application where multiple coaches can be added. Users can send coaching requests to the coaches listed in the app. For the purpose of demonstration, Firebase Realtime Database is utilized as the backend database. By implementing Vue Router and Vuex, the project demonstrates essential routing and state management concepts in Vue.js.
